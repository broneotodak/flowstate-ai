# FlowState AI - Session Continuation (July 2, 2025)

## üéâ Major Achievements This Session

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
1. **AI Embeddings System**
   - Created `context_embeddings` table with pgvector
   - Generated embeddings for 22 items (tasks + project_phases)
   - Semantic search working with Cmd+K
   - Dashboard shows embedding coverage

2. **Automated Git Tracking**
   - Git hooks installed and working perfectly
   - Tracks: commits, branch switches, pushes
   - Service key configured and tested
   - Real-time context updates confirmed

3. **Fixed Critical Issues**
   - Timezone bug fixed (was showing "8h ago")
   - Dashboard now shows "Just now" correctly
   - Added 'Z' suffix handling for UTC timestamps
   - RefreshGitHub button error fixed

4. **Browser Extension**
   - Fully built and loaded in Chrome
   - Detects active project from tabs
   - Shows confidence level
   - Ready for service key configuration

5. **GitHub Webhooks**
   - Edge Function ready at `/supabase/functions/github-webhook`
   - Tracks PRs, issues, all GitHub events
   - Not yet deployed

## üöÄ Current Status
- **Dashboard**: flowstate.neotodak.com (working perfectly)
- **Database**: YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
- **Git Hooks**: Active on flowstate-ai-github repo
- **Context**: Updating automatically with each commit
- **Last Task**: "Fix timezone parsing - append Z to timestamps"

## üìÅ Key Files Created
```
/browser-extension/          # Chrome extension (loaded, needs service key fix)
/supabase/functions/        # Edge functions ready to deploy
/sql/                       # Database schemas
*.html                      # Various tools and fixes
install-flowstate-git-hooks.sh  # Git hooks installer
```

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. Fix Browser Extension Service Key Issue
The extension loads but service key isn't working. Need to:
- Debug why service key isn't triggering tracking
- Check console errors when saving settings
- Verify the background script is receiving the key

### 2. Deploy GitHub Webhooks
```bash
supabase functions deploy github-webhook --no-verify-jwt
```

### 3. Create AI Memory Tracker
Build system to track Claude/ChatGPT conversations and link to projects

### 4. Improve Browser Extension
- Add more project detection patterns
- Visual indicators when tracking
- Options page for configuration

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
- Time spent per project
- Activity heatmaps
- Productivity insights

## üêõ Known Issues
1. Browser extension service key not triggering activity logging
2. Dashboard shows "activities: 0/30" (activities table exists but that stat is wrong)
3. `get_embedding_stats` function counts non-existent tables

## üí° Architecture Overview
```
Your Work ‚Üí Git Hooks ‚Üí activities table ‚Üí current_context ‚Üí Dashboard
         ‚Üò Browser Ext ‚Üó                                   ‚Üó
          ‚Üò GitHub Webhooks ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üó
```

## üîë Important Context
- Service Role Key is stored in:
  - `.git/hooks/flowstate-track.sh` (working)
  - Browser extension settings (not working yet)
- All timestamps must include 'Z' suffix for UTC
- Dashboard auto-refreshes context every 60 seconds
- Git hooks are the primary tracking method (working perfectly)

## To Continue:
Reference this file when starting a new session. The main priority is fixing the browser extension's service key handling so it can log activities automatically.
