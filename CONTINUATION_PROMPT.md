# FlowState AI Continuation Prompt

## Context
I'm Neo Todak, and we just finished a major session working on FlowState AI (https://flowstate.neotodak.com). The dashboard was broken after we cleaned up tables for TODAK AI project, but we've successfully restored and enhanced it.

## Current State of FlowState AI
- **Location**: H:\Projects\Active\flowstate-ai
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/broneotodak/flowstate-ai
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploys via Netlify to flowstate.neotodak.com
- **Database**: Supabase project uzamamymfzhelvkwpvgt

## Features Currently Implemented
1. **Core Dashboard** ✓
   - Current context tracking (active project, task, phase)
   - Project grid with progress percentages and status
   - Recent activity feed with real-time updates
   - Tools & Machines tracking section

2. **Memory Integration** ✓
   - Trigger function auto-converts ClaudeN memory saves to activities
   - Supports milestone, solution, deployment, bug_fix types
   - Shows different icons for each activity type

3. **GitHub Integration** ✓
   - github_commits table stores commit history
   - Shows recent commits with add/delete stats
   - "Sync GitHub" button (needs API integration)

4. **Time Tracking** ✓
   - Active timer with live counter
   - time_tracking and active_sessions tables
   - Daily summaries by project with progress bars
   - Stop button to end sessions

5. **Task System** ✓
   - Tasks with status tracking
   - task_dependencies table for linked tasks
   - Project phases support

## Tables Created
- current_context
- activity_log
- tasks
- project_owners
- project_phases
- project_status
- user_tools
- user_machines
- github_commits
- task_dependencies
- time_tracking
- active_sessions
- project_metrics

## Recent Changes
- REMOVED analytics charts due to high RAM usage (Chart.js was too heavy)
- Fixed timestamp issues in activity feed
- Added memory->activity trigger integration

## Known Issues
1. Recent activity timestamps sometimes show old dates
2. GitHub sync needs actual API integration
3. Task dependencies UI not yet implemented

## Next Priorities
1. Implement actual GitHub API integration for commit syncing
2. Add task dependency visualization
3. Create lighter-weight analytics (maybe CSS-based)
4. Add project quick-switch dropdown
5. Implement task creation UI
6. Add time tracking start button for projects

## Technical Notes
- Using Supabase realtime subscriptions for live updates
- No localStorage/sessionStorage (not supported in Claude artifacts)
- All state managed through Supabase
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)

Please help me continue improving FlowState AI. The codebase is clean and well-structured, ready for the next features!
