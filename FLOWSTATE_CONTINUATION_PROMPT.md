# FlowState Continuation Prompt

## Context for New Terminal Session

I've been working on the FlowState AI dashboard project. Here's what we accomplished today (July 4, 2025):

### What We Fixed:
1. **Dashboard Rebuilt** - Replaced broken dashboard with working version that only queries existing tables
2. **Browser Extension Fixed** - Corrected Supabase URL, added machine tracking, auto-detects all GitHub projects
3. **Database Truth Established** - Created critical pgvector memory to prevent table duplication
4. **Memory System Issues Identified** - Found that claude_desktop_memory table has messy data (wrong source fields, null owners)

### Current State:
- **Live Dashboard**: flowstate.neotodak.com (auto-deploys from GitHub)
- **Working Tables**: activity_log, current_context, user_machines, context_embeddings
- **Service Key**: Stored in ~/.flowstate/config
- **Auto-Tracking**: Git hooks ready, browser extension fixed, daemon running (PID stored in ~/.flowstate/daemon.pid)

### Key Files Created:
- `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai-github/index.html` - New working dashboard
- `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai-github/flowstate-universal-logger.js` - Logger for all tools
- `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai-github/flowstate-database-truth.js` - Database documentation
- `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai-github/auto-memory-updater.js` - Hourly memory updates
- `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai-github/sql/create-missing-tables.sql` - For future expansion

### Critical Knowledge:
- **USE activity_log NOT activities** (activities table doesn't exist!)
- **All tools must identify themselves properly** in the source field
- **Owner field should never be null** - always 'neo_todak'
- **Check pgvector memory before creating any new tables**

### Next Steps We Should Work On:
1. **Enhanced Dashboard Features**:
   - Add semantic search using context_embeddings
   - Implement task management UI
   - Add time tracking functionality
   - Create project switching interface

2. **Fix Memory System**:
   - Run the SQL fixes for claude_desktop_memory
   - Create migration tool for better memory organization
   - Implement memory search interface

3. **Better Integrations**:
   - Create VSCode extension package
   - Add Cursor AI auto-configuration
   - Build CLI tool for quick activity logging
   - Add voice note support

4. **Analytics & Insights**:
   - Daily/weekly activity reports
   - Project time analysis
   - Productivity insights
   - Machine usage patterns

### To Continue:
```bash
cd /Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai-github
source ~/.flowstate/config

# Check current status
~/.flowstate/flowstate-daemon.js status
git status

# View recent activities
curl -s "${FLOWSTATE_SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1/activity_log?select=*&order=created_at.desc&limit=5" \
  -H "apikey: ${FLOWSTATE_SERVICE_KEY}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FLOWSTATE_SERVICE_KEY}" | jq '.'
```

### Important Context from pgvector:
- FlowState database truth is documented in context_embeddings
- Memory storage standard created to fix the messy memory system
- All project updates are automatically embedded hourly

### Questions to Continue With:
1. Should we add semantic search to the dashboard?
2. Do you want to fix the memory system issues now?
3. Should we create better integration packages for your tools?
4. Want to add analytics and insights features?

The FlowState system is now working with real-time tracking from browser, git, and system monitoring. The dashboard shows activities, machines, and current context. All tools are logging properly, and the pgvector memory ensures continuity.
