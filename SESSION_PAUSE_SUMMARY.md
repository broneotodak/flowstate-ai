# FlowState AI Debug Session - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: July 31, 2025  
**Status**: RESOLVED - Ready for v1.2 deployment  
**User**: Taking AFK break

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished
Successfully debugged and fixed FlowState AI v1.1 memory sync regression.

## 🔍 Root Cause Found
- **Problem**: v1.1 app used 2-hour API time filter
- **Database**: Had 2,675 activities but most recent was 14.7 hours old
- **Result**: API returned empty array [] despite 200 response

## ✅ Solution Applied
1. **Extended time window**: 2 hours → 24 hours in `FlowStateViewModel.swift`
2. **Verified fix**: API now returns 31 activities (vs 0 before)
3. **Fixed project names**: Updated "Unknown Project" to proper names
4. **Explained THR display**: User recently working on THR project (correct behavior)

## 📱 Test Results
```
Before Fix: 0 activities returned
After Fix:  31 activities returned
App Status: ✅ Working correctly
```
