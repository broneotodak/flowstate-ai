# FlowState Deployment Guide

## Netlify Environment Variables

This app requires the following environment variables to be set in Netlify:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon (public) key

These are PUBLIC environment variables that are safe to expose in the browser. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix tells Netlify that these are intentionally public.

## Setting Environment Variables in Netlify

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your FlowState site
3. Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
4. Add the two variables listed above
5. Trigger a redeploy

The build script will automatically inject these values into the app during build time.
