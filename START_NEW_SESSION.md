# Quick Start: New FlowState Session

Just paste this in a new terminal:

```
I need to continue working on FlowState. Here's the session summary: /Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai-github/FLOWSTATE_SESSION_SUMMARY.md

Current status:
- Dashboard: flowstate.neotodak.com (working)
- 2 machines active (MacBook, Office PC)
- Unified pgvector system implemented
- All activities logging to context_embeddings

What should we work on next?
```

This will give me full context in the new session!
