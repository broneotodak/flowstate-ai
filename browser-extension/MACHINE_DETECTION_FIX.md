# Browser Extension Machine Detection Fix

## Problem
The browser extension was not being detected as a separate machine. Activities were being logged with the OS hostname (e.g., `MacBook-Pro-3.local`) instead of a unique browser extension identifier.

## Solution Implemented (v1.0.1)

### 1. Unique Machine Identification
- Browser extension now identifies itself as `{Browser} Extension ({OS})`
- Example: `Chrome Extension (macOS)`
- Each browser/OS combination gets its own machine entry

### 2. Browser Info Detection
- Detects browser type (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Captures browser version
- Identifies operating system

### 3. Machine Registration
- Automatically creates machine entry in `context_embeddings` table
- Sets machine_type as `browser_extension`
- Uses 🌐 icon for browser extensions

### 4. Unified Logging
- Now uses the `log_activity_unified` RPC function
- Consistent with other FlowState tools
- Includes browser metadata in activities

## How It Works with Other Machines

The FlowState ecosystem tracks activities across multiple machines:

1. **Physical Machines** (Desktop/Laptop)
   - Tracked via git hooks and local tools
   - Identified by OS hostname
   - Examples: `MacBook-Pro-3.local`, `Office PC`

2. **Browser Extensions** 
   - Each browser/OS combo is a unique machine
   - Activities include browser-specific metadata
   - Can track across multiple browsers on same device

3. **Machine Hierarchy**
   ```

   ├── MacBook Pro (laptop) 💻
   ├── Office PC (desktop) 🏢
   ├── Chrome Extension (macOS) 🌐
   ├── Firefox Extension (macOS) 🌐
   └── Edge Extension (Windows) 🌐
   ```

4. **Activity Attribution**
   - Each activity is linked to specific machine
   - Dashboard shows activities grouped by machine
   - Machine status (active/inactive) based on last activity

## Testing the Fix

1. Reload the extension in Chrome
2. Browse to tracked sites (GitHub, Claude.ai)
3. Check dashboard for new machine entry
4. Verify activities show correct machine name

## Database Impact
- Creates new entries in `context_embeddings` with type='machine'
- Activities will reference the new machine name
- Old activities remain linked to OS hostname
