# FlowState Browser Extension Troubleshooting

## Extension won't load/install

### 1. "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"
- Make sure you're selecting the `browser-extension` folder, not a parent folder
- The folder must contain `manifest.json` directly

### 2. "Could not load background script 'background.js'"
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled in chrome://extensions/

### 3. Extension loads but shows errors in chrome://extensions/
- Click "Errors" to see details
- Common issues:
  - Missing service key (configure in popup)
  - Network errors (check internet connection)

- Enter your Supabase service key (get from `~/.flowstate/config`)
