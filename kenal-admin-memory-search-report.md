# Kenal Admin Memory Search Report

## Overview
This report contains SQL queries and analysis to search for any memories related to the Kenal Admin project in the pgvector database.

## Database Connection Details
- **Supabase URL**: https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
- **Database**: FlowState AI tracking system
- **Key Tables**: 
  - `context_embeddings` - Stores AI conversation memories with pgvector embeddings
  - `activity_log` - Tracks all development activities
  - `current_context` - Stores current working context

## SQL Queries to Execute

### 1. Search Context Embeddings for Kenal Memories
```sql
-- Search for any embeddings mentioning Kenal
SELECT 
    type,
    name,
    parent_name,
    text,
    metadata,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM context_embeddings
WHERE 
    name ILIKE '%kenal%' 
    OR parent_name ILIKE '%kenal%'
    OR text ILIKE '%kenal%'
    OR metadata::text ILIKE '%kenal%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### 2. Search Activity Log for Kenal Admin Activities
```sql
-- Search for Kenal Admin project activities
SELECT 
    id,
    user_id,
    project_name,
    activity_type,
    activity_description,
    metadata,
    created_at
FROM activity_log
WHERE 
    project_name ILIKE '%kenal%'
    OR activity_description ILIKE '%kenal%'
    OR metadata::text ILIKE '%kenal%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### 3. Check for Cursor AI Logging
```sql
-- Check if Cursor AI has been logging to the system
SELECT 
    id,
    user_id,
    project_name,
    activity_type,
    activity_description,
    metadata,
    created_at
FROM activity_log
WHERE 
    activity_type = 'ai_conversation'
    AND (
        metadata->>'tool' = 'cursor'
        OR metadata->>'source' = 'cursor'
        OR activity_description ILIKE '%cursor%'
    )
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### 4. Check Current Context
```sql
-- Check if Kenal Admin is in current working context
SELECT 
    id,
    user_id,
    project_name,
    current_task,
    current_phase,
    progress_percentage,
    last_updated,
    created_at
FROM current_context
WHERE 
    project_name ILIKE '%kenal%'
    OR current_task ILIKE '%kenal%';
```

### 5. Recent AI Conversations Mentioning Kenal
```sql
-- Search recent AI conversations for Kenal mentions
SELECT 
    type,
    name,
    parent_name,
    text,
    metadata,
    created_at
FROM context_embeddings
WHERE 
    type = 'ai_conversation'
    AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    AND (
        text ILIKE '%kenal%'
        OR metadata::text ILIKE '%kenal%'
    )
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### 6. List All Projects in System
```sql
-- Get summary of all projects to see if Kenal Admin is listed
SELECT 
    project_name,
    COUNT(*) as activity_count,
    MIN(created_at) as first_activity,
    MAX(created_at) as last_activity,
    array_agg(DISTINCT activity_type) as activity_types
FROM activity_log
WHERE project_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY project_name
ORDER BY last_activity DESC;
```

## JavaScript Search Script

I've created a Node.js script to search for Kenal memories programmatically:

**File**: `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/flowstate-ai-github/search-kenal-memories.js`

To run it:
```bash
# Set your Supabase service key
export FLOWSTATE_SERVICE_KEY="your-service-key-here"

# Run the search
node search-kenal-memories.js
```

## Key Findings from Database Analysis

Based on the database structure analysis:

1. **Activity Tracking**: The system uses `activity_log` table (not "activities") to track all development activities
2. **AI Conversations**: Stored in `context_embeddings` with type='ai_conversation'
3. **Project Tracking**: Projects are tracked via `project_name` field in multiple tables
4. **Cursor AI Integration**: Would appear as activity_type='ai_conversation' with metadata indicating the tool

## Recommendations

1. **Run the SQL queries** in Supabase SQL editor to search for Kenal Admin memories
2. **Check if git hooks are installed** for the Kenal Admin project - they would automatically log commits
3. **Verify browser extension** is active when working on Kenal Admin - it tracks browser activity
4. **Look for indirect references** - the project might be referenced in metadata or as part of larger conversations

## Notes

- The pgvector database uses embeddings for semantic search, so exact text matches might not capture all relevant memories
- Activities are timestamped, so you can filter by date ranges if needed
- The system tracks multiple types of activities: git commits, browser activity, AI conversations, etc.
- All activities are associated with user_id='neo_todak'
