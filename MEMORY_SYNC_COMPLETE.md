# FlowState Memory Sync - Complete Solution ✅

## What We Built
A complete memory synchronization system that bridges the todak-ai pgvector memory system with FlowState activity tracking.

## Key Components

### 1. **memory-to-activity-sync.js**
- Monitors `claude_desktop_memory` table for new entries
- Intelligently extracts and normalizes project names
- Filters out garbage entries
- Supports project filtering with `--project` flag
- Can run once or continuously

### 2. **claude-log**
- Quick command to log Claude Code activities
- Usage: `./claude-log "description of work"`
- Saves to pgvector memory for automatic sync

### 3. **cleanup-non-flowstate-activities.js**
- Removes incorrectly synced activities from other projects
- Interactive confirmation before deletion

### 4. **setup-memory-sync.sh**
- Creates system service for automatic startup
- Configures to sync only FlowState activities by default
- Works on macOS (launchd) and Linux (systemd)

## How It Works

```
Claude Desktop → Auto-saves → claude_desktop_memory ✅
Claude Code → Manual save → claude-log → claude_desktop_memory ✅
Cursor → Manual save → claude-log → claude_desktop_memory ✅
↓
memory-to-activity-sync.js (runs every 5 min)
↓
Filters by project, normalizes names, creates activities
↓
activity_log table
↓
FlowState Dashboard displays activities ✅
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Save current work to memory
./claude-log "Built memory sync system"

# Sync only FlowState memories once
node memory-to-activity-sync.js --once --project flowstate

# Start continuous sync (FlowState only)
node memory-to-activity-sync.js --continuous --project flowstate

# Set up automatic startup
./setup-memory-sync.sh

# Clean up non-FlowState activities
node cleanup-non-flowstate-activities.js
```

## Key Features
- ✅ Project filtering prevents cross-contamination
- ✅ Intelligent project name normalization
- ✅ Automatic machine activity tracking
- ✅ Preserves full metadata for debugging
- ✅ Minimal resource usage
- ✅ Easy manual logging for Claude Code/Cursor

## Result
FlowState dashboard now accurately displays only FlowState activities, with proper tool attribution and real-time updates!
